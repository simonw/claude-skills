## Creating a skills archive with a prompt

Created by prompting [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai):

> `Create a zip file of everything in your /mnt/skills folder`
>
[Run that prompt on Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/new?q=Create%20a%20zip%20file%20of%20everything%20in%20your%20%2Fmnt%2Fskills%20folder)
